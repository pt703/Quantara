Project: Quantara – Adaptive Financial Literacy Learning App
Tech stack: React Native + Expo + TypeScript
I want you to generate a React Native + Expo app (TypeScript) that I can later open in VS Code and continue developing. The app is called Quantara and it is an adaptive financial education application. For now, you should implement a clean, production-style prototype with mocked data and simple local state (no real backend required yet), but structure the code so it will be easy to plug in real APIs and reinforcement-learning logic later.
🔧 Technical requirements
Use Expo and TypeScript
Use React Navigation (stack + bottom tab or stack + nested stacks)
Use functional components with React Hooks
Use a simple structure like:
App.tsx
src/navigation/
src/screens/
src/components/
src/hooks/
src/types/
src/mock/ (for fake data)
For local data, use mock JSON or in-memory arrays. If needed, use AsyncStorage for simple persistence.
Keep styling clean and modern (no UI library required, just StyleSheet), but make the layout look like a real app, not just raw text.
📱 Core concept of Quantara
Quantara is an app that helps young adults build financial literacy and better money habits through:
Bite-sized lessons and quizzes
Interactive challenges (e.g., “cancel one unused subscription this week”)
A simple financial snapshot (loans, subscriptions, savings goal)
A “Recommended for you” section that will later be driven by RL, but for now should be mocked.
This prototype does not need real banks, real money, or real RL — just believable structure and UI.
🧭 Navigation & Screens
Implement at least the following screens with navigation wired up:
1. Onboarding / Welcome Screen
Name: WelcomeScreen
Content:
App name: Quantara
Short tagline: “Adaptive financial coaching for your real life.”
Two buttons: “Get Started” and “Log In” (both can just navigate into the main app for now).
Design: clean, simple illustration-like blocks using basic shapes or gradients, no images required.
2. Home / Dashboard Screen
Name: HomeScreen
This is the main landing page after onboarding.
Show:
A greeting: “Hi, Nemo” (hardcoded name is fine for now, but structure it so it can be changed later).
A “Financial Snapshot” card with:
Monthly income (mock)
Total debt (mock)
Active subscriptions count (mock)
Current savings goal and % progress (mock)
A “Continue Learning” card: shows the next lesson title + progress bar (e.g., “Understanding Interest Rates – 40% complete”).
A “Recommended for you” section:
2–3 cards with:
Lesson name (e.g., “Student Loans Basics”)
Tag: “Lesson” / “Challenge” / “Simulation”
Short description (1–2 lines)
A “Start” button that navigates to the appropriate screen.
Use mock data from a mock/recommendations.ts file.
3. Learn: Modules & Lessons
You can implement this as a separate tab or screen.
3.1 Learn Overview Screen
Name: LearnScreen
List of modules, e.g.:
“Foundations: Budgeting & Saving”
“Debt & Interest”
“Investing Basics”
Each module shows:
Progress % (mocked)
Number of completed lessons / total lessons
On press → navigate to ModuleDetailScreen.
3.2 Module Detail Screen
Name: ModuleDetailScreen
Shows:
Module title and short description
List of lessons in this module (pulled from mock data)
Example lesson fields:
id
title
type ("lesson" | "quiz" | "simulation")
estimatedMinutes
completionStatus
On tap a lesson → navigate to LessonScreen.
3.3 Lesson / Quiz Screen
Name: LessonScreen
For a lesson:
Show content as a vertical scroll:
Title
2–3 short paragraphs of placeholder text about a topic (e.g., “What is compound interest?”).
At the bottom, a “Mark as Complete” button. For now, use local state to mark that lesson as complete and update UI.
For a quiz:
Mock 3–4 multiple-choice questions (static JSON).
Show radio buttons / touchable options.
Simple scoring logic (count correct answers and show score summary).
At the end, show:
Score
Simple feedback text: “Great job!” / “Review this again later.”
No backend required.
4. Challenges / Habits Screen
Name: ChallengesScreen
Purpose: show behaviour-oriented tasks, not just knowledge.
Each challenge card has:
Title (e.g., “Track every expense for 3 days”)
Category (e.g., “Spending”, “Debt”, “Subscriptions”)
Status: “Not started”, “In progress”, “Completed”
Allow the user to tap a challenge to view details (ChallengeDetailScreen), and toggle its status through local state (e.g., mark as completed).
We will later connect this to habit-tracking and RL-based recommendations, so structure the data model cleanly.
5. Financial Snapshot / Profile Screen
You can combine into one screen, or keep separate.
Name: ProfileScreen or SnapshotScreen
Show:
Editable mock data for:
Monthly income
Monthly expenses
Total debt (e.g., student loan + credit card)
Subscriptions (e.g., Netflix, Spotify)
For now, use simple UI:
List of subscriptions with name + monthly cost + toggle for “keep/cancel” (local only).
Optional: a simple “What if?” area:
Text: “If you cancelled these 2 subscriptions, you would save £X/month.”
The number £X is computed from the toggled items.
This doesn’t need to store to a backend; just manage state.
6. Settings Screen
Name: SettingsScreen
Minimal:
“Notification preferences” (toggles, not functional)
“Data & Privacy” (static text)
“Log out” (can just show an alert or navigate back to WelcomeScreen)
🧩 Data & Types (for the AI to structure nicely)
Use TypeScript types like:
type LessonType = 'lesson' | 'quiz' | 'simulation';

interface Lesson {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  type: LessonType;
  estimatedMinutes: number;
  completionStatus: 'not_started' | 'in_progress' | 'completed';
}

interface Module {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  progress: number; // 0–100
  lessons: Lesson[];
}

interface Challenge {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  category: 'spending' | 'debt' | 'subscriptions' | 'saving';
  status: 'not_started' | 'in_progress' | 'completed';
  description: string;
}

interface Recommendation {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  kind: 'lesson' | 'challenge' | 'simulation';
  shortDescription: string;
}
Put mock data into src/mock/modules.ts, src/mock/challenges.ts, src/mock/recommendations.ts.
🎨 Design style
Clean, minimal, modern.
Use:
Cards with rounded corners
Soft shadows or borders
Progress bars for modules/lessons where relevant
No need for fancy animation; just make it feel like a real app you’d actually ship.
🚀 Final Expected Output
A React Native + Expo TypeScript project that:
Compiles and runs with npm start / expo start
Has working navigation between:
Welcome → Home → Learn → Module → Lesson
Home → Challenges → Challenge Detail
Home → Snapshot/Profile
Settings
Uses mock data + local state
Is clearly structured so I can later:
Replace mock data with real API calls
Add RL logic for content selection
Integrate authentication and real persistence
